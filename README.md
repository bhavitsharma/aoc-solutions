# AOC Solutions (and commentary)

**NOTE: I didn't create special functions to solve part1, part2 separetely. All the soln's will work for part 2**
**To solve part 1, you'll have to make few modifications**

- I am learning haskell right now so expect that my solutions are ugly, overly verbose and non functionally written.
- If you have ideas on how to improve, please raise a PR. I will really appreciate it.
- Haskell Template shamelesly copied from [srid-template](https://github.com/srid/haskell-template)
- TODO: Need to pass around state variables?
- TODO: How to have nice 2d/3d arrays with good mapping abilities and indices? I think `repa` library is good for this.
- Why the fuck writing a DFS is so hard in haskell?
- Maybe it's time to learn Monads.
- YAY, Learnt State Monad and solved dynamic programming using haskell. P21.
- State Monads are so beautiful.
- One of the pain points while using lists/arrays is that I don't an efficient or a trivial way to do them.
- Moreover, traversing 2d arrays and stuff were too easy in C++. In Haskell, it's just a pain. Maybe $ Missing Something obvious.
