# AOC Solutions (and commentary)

- I am learning haskell right now so expect that my solutions are ugly, overly verbose and non functionally written.
- If you have ideas on how to improve, please raise a PR. I will really appreciate it.
- Haskell Template shamelesly copied from [srid-template](https://github.com/srid/haskell-template)
- TODO: Need to pass around state variables?
- TODO: How to have nice 2d/3d arrays with good mapping abilities and indices? I think `repa` library is good for this.
- Why the fuck writing a DFS is so hard in haskell?
- Maybe it's time to learn Monads.
